# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Sample Application
# changed on master
This is the first application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) 

I'm following along with the book.

This is a very good tutorial.

I have also added a git Post-Receive URL
This line is testing to see if the hook is working
